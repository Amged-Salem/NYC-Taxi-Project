# NYC Taxi Data Project

This project demonstrates a complete big data pipeline and analytics workflow using the NYC Taxi dataset. We leverage Hadoop (HDFS), Apache Hive, and PySpark to showcase real-world data engineering and analysis techniques.

## Project Structure & Parts

- **HDFS Practice (Part A):** Organizing and managing data in HDFS
- **Hive Tables (Part B & C):** Creating managed and external tables, understanding their differences
- **Partitioning & Bucketing (Part D & E):** Partitioning data by year/month and bucketing by pickup location for performance
- **Joins & Data Enrichment (Part F):** Joining trip data with zone information for richer analysis
- **Transactional (ACID) Tables (Part G):** Implementing Hive tables that support updates and deletes
- **PySpark Analysis:** Data cleaning, feature engineering, and extracting key insights using PySpark

## Key Findings

- Credit cards are the main payment method; solo travelers tip the most
- Manhattan has the highest trip volume but lowest revenue per trip
- Airports are the most profitable zones
- Peak demand is in the afternoon across all boroughs
- Most trips are short, but airport runs bring in the highest fares

## About

This project covers the full spectrum from raw data ingestion to actionable business insights, providing hands-on experience with big data tools and analytics.
